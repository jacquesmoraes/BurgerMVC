This is a Snack Ecommerce project, a web application designed for selling snacks online. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns, making it more maintainable and scalable.

## 2. MVC Architecture
The project is organized around the MVC architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. This includes the data structure for snacks, user accounts, orders, and any other application-specific information. The model interacts with the database to manage data.

- **View**: Defines the user interface and presentation. It handles the rendering of web pages, including snack listings, user profiles, shopping cart, and checkout forms.

- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view. Controllers handle user input, process requests, update the model, and render the appropriate view. They manage the application's flow and logic.
